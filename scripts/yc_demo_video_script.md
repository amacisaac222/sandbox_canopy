## Script Structure

### [0-15 seconds] Hook & Problem Setup
**[Talking head to camera]**
"Imagine your AI agent just tried to delete your entire production database because it misunderstood a customer request. This happened to a Fortune 500 company last month. Here's how CanopyIQ prevents this."

### [15-30 seconds] Problem Demonstration
**[Screen: Show chaotic scenario]**
"Right now, when companies deploy AI agents, they're flying blind. Agents have unlimited access to APIs, can spend unlimited money, and leave no audit trail. It's like giving a new intern root access to everything."

### [30-90 seconds] CanopyIQ Console Walkthrough
**[Screen: CanopyIQ dashboard]**

**[30-45s] Overview Dashboard**
"This is the CanopyIQ console. Every AI agent in the enterprise runs through our control plane. Here you can see 47 agents currently active across different teams."

**[45-60s] Approval Workflows**
"When an agent tries to do something risky - like deleting files or spending money - it triggers our approval workflow. The agent pauses, Slack alerts go to the right people, and humans decide whether to allow it."

**[60-75s] Budget Controls**
"Each agent has spending limits. Marketing's agent can spend $500/month on ad campaigns, but it can't touch the $50K production budget. No more surprise cloud bills."

**[75-90s] Audit Trail**
"Everything is logged immutably. Security teams can see exactly what every agent did, when, and who approved it. Full compliance with SOX and ISO requirements."

### [90-135 seconds] Enterprise Value Demo
**[Screen: Show policy engine]**

**[90-105s] Policy Engine**
"Policies are code. 'No agent can delete databases between 9-5.' 'Marketing agents can't access customer PII.' 'All financial transactions require dual approval.' These rules enforce automatically."

**[105-120s] Multi-tenant Architecture**
"Each department gets their own sandbox. HR's recruiting agent can't see Finance's data. Developers can test new agents safely without affecting production."

**[120-135s] Integration Showcase**
"Works with any AI platform - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models. Agents think they're talking directly to APIs, but we're intercepting everything for governance."

### [135-165 seconds] Business Impact
**[Split screen: dashboard metrics + talking head]**

**[135-150s] ROI Metrics**
"Our pilot customers prevented an average of 3 potential security incidents per month. They reduced AI-related cloud spend by 40% through budget controls."

**[150-165s] Market Positioning**
"We're becoming the Okta for AI agents. Just like no enterprise would let employees access systems without SSO, no enterprise should let AI agents run without CanopyIQ."

### [165-180 seconds] Closing & CTA
**[Talking head to camera]**
"Fortune 500 companies are already deploying this in production. We're raising our seed round to become the default platform that every enterprise AI agent runs inside. The future of AI is governed, audited, and secure."
