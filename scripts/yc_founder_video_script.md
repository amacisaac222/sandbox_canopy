## Script (55 seconds)

**[0-8 seconds] Introduction**
"Hi YC, I'm [Your Name], founder of CanopyIQ. I'm a [your background - e.g., former Google engineer, enterprise security expert, etc.]."

**[8-25 seconds] Problem Statement**
"Enterprise companies want to deploy AI agents, but they're terrified of giving ChatGPT access to their AWS accounts or Slack channels. One rogue agent could delete their entire production database or leak customer data to competitors. Today, they have no way to control what their AI agents can actually do."

**[25-45 seconds] Solution**
"CanopyIQ is the enterprise control plane for AI agents. We're like Okta for AI - every agent request goes through our approval workflows, budget controls, and audit logs. Companies can finally deploy agents safely with the same governance they use for human employees."

**[45-55 seconds] Traction & Ask**
"We're already in pilot with three Fortune 500 companies. We're raising our seed round to become the default sandbox that every enterprise AI agent runs inside."

**[55-60 seconds] Closing**
"Thanks for watching - excited to talk more."
