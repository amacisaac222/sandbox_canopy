# YC Video Recording Guide - CanopyIQ

## Equipment Setup

### Essential Equipment:
- **Camera**: Webcam (1080p minimum) or smartphone camera
- **Audio**: External microphone (USB or lapel mic) - built-in mics often have poor quality
- **Lighting**: Ring light, desk lamp, or natural window light
- **Background**: Clean, professional space or virtual background

### Software:
- **Screen Recording**: OBS Studio (free), Loom, or Camtasia
- **Video Editing**: DaVinci Resolve (free), iMovie, or Adobe Premiere
- **Audio**: Audacity (free) for audio cleanup if needed

## Pre-Recording Checklist

### Technical Setup:
- [ ] Test camera focus and framing
- [ ] Check audio levels (speak at normal volume)
- [ ] Ensure stable internet connection
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Set phone to airplane mode
- [ ] Test screen recording software
- [ ] Prepare demo environment with clean data

### Content Preparation:
- [ ] Practice founder script 5+ times out loud
- [ ] Time each section with stopwatch
- [ ] Prepare CanopyIQ demo environment
- [ ] Write down key transition phrases
- [ ] Have water nearby (but not visible on camera)

## Recording Best Practices

### Founder Video (Talking Head):
- **Camera Position**: Eye level, arm's length away
- **Framing**: Head and shoulders visible, some space above head
- **Eye Contact**: Look directly at camera lens, not screen
- **Posture**: Sit up straight, lean slightly forward (shows engagement)
- **Gestures**: Natural hand movements, keep hands visible
- **Energy**: Smile genuinely, speak with conviction
- **Pace**: Speak clearly but naturally, pause between key points

### Demo Video (Screen Recording):
- **Resolution**: Record in 1080p (1920x1080)
- **Mouse Movement**: Slow, deliberate movements
- **Cursor**: Highlight important elements
- **Zoom**: Ensure text is readable (browser zoom 125-150%)
- **Transitions**: Pause briefly between screens
- **Audio**: Clear, consistent volume throughout

## Shot List & Timing

### Founder Video Shots:
1. **Wide Shot** (0-60s): Full talking head framing
2. **Optional**: Cutaway to workspace/product (if time permits)

### Demo Video Shots:
1. **Intro Talking Head** (0-15s): Brief hook
2. **Problem Illustration** (15-30s): Chaotic scenario
3. **Dashboard Tour** (30-90s): Main product screens  
4. **Deep Dive Features** (90-135s): Policy engine, approvals
5. **Impact Metrics** (135-165s): Split screen with data
6. **Closing Talking Head** (165-180s): Call to action

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Founder Video:
- ❌ Reading from script (sounds robotic)
- ❌ Looking away from camera
- ❌ Speaking too fast to fit everything in
- ❌ Poor lighting (shadows on face)
- ❌ Distracting background noise

### Demo Video:
- ❌ Moving mouse too quickly
- ❌ Clicking before explaining what you're doing
- ❌ Using real customer data
- ❌ Long awkward pauses
- ❌ Inconsistent audio levels

## Quality Standards

### Video Requirements:
- **Resolution**: 1080p minimum
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps
- **Duration**: Founder (60s max), Demo (180s max)
- **File Size**: Under 500MB per video

### Audio Requirements:
- **Quality**: Clear speech, no background noise
- **Volume**: Consistent levels throughout
- **Sync**: Audio perfectly synced with video
- **Format**: AAC codec, 44.1kHz sample rate

## Post-Production Checklist

### Basic Editing:
- [ ] Trim dead air from beginning/end
- [ ] Adjust audio levels for consistency
- [ ] Add subtle background music (optional, keep low)
- [ ] Color correct if needed (proper skin tones)
- [ ] Export in correct format and quality

### Final Review:
- [ ] Watch both videos start to finish
- [ ] Check for any technical issues
- [ ] Verify timing meets requirements
- [ ] Test playback on different devices
- [ ] Get feedback from trusted colleague

## Backup Plan

If initial recording has issues:
1. **Audio Problems**: Re-record voiceover separately and sync
2. **Video Quality Issues**: Use better lighting, different camera angle
3. **Content Issues**: Focus on strongest parts, cut weak sections
4. **Timing Issues**: Speed up delivery slightly or trim transitions

## Final Tips

- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Record multiple takes, choose the best
- **Energy is Contagious**: Your enthusiasm sells the product
- **Authenticity Wins**: Be yourself, don't oversell
- **Technical Excellence**: YC judges notice production quality
- **Storytelling**: Problem → Solution → Impact narrative structure
